# CapstoneProjectModule2

In the Capstone Project Module 2, the writer was doing an Explanatory Data Analysis on a simple study case where the chosen topic is online retail shipping. It involved the writer with positioning himself as a data analyst for an e-commerce company where the writer would generate several questions to be solved as a main challenge faced by the company in a made-up scenario. After stating the problems, then the writer would define a stakeholder to address the challenge to and provided insights from such analysis on what were the key factors that each warehouse was lacking and recommended solutions to the stakeholder in order to make a business decision making.
